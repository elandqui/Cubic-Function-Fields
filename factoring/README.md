# Factoring

This contains various programs to factor integers. These are necessary to automate the factorization of divisor class numbers in order to extract ideal class numbers and regulators.

**basic.cc** does trial division.

**lenstra.cc** implements the Elliptic Curve Method for factoring.

**pollard_p1.cc** implements Pollard's p-1 method.

**pollard_rho.cc** implements Pollard's Rho method.

**shanks.cc** implements Shanks' SQUFOF (square form factoring) method.

**williams_p1.cc** implements Williams' p+1 method.
