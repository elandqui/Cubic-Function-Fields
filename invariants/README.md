  # libinvariants library
  
  **invariants.cc** 

  Contains global variables for use by any program computing with 
  cubic function fields.

  To make the library libinvariants, put invariants.cc, invariants.h, and
  makefile into a directory, Invariants. Make sure the path to NTL and GMP 
  are set correctly in the makefile and run make.
