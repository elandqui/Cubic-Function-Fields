# Cubic-Function-Fields

**libcubic** contains files to make the library libcubic.a, which is a library to perform various arithmetic operations in the ideal class group and infrastructure of a cubic function field over a finite field of characteristic at least 5.

**landquist-thesis.pdf** is my Ph.D. dissertation, which contains the theory behind much of the code in this repository, along with the results of many of the calculations. This was submitted January 2009.
